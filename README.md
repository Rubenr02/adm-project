# Project Overview
Greecebnb is aimed to simplify the process of identifying and booking rental houses, responding to the various demands of consumers seeking temporary housing options. 
By combining convenience, accessibility, and usefulness, the platform aims to provide a seamless user experience.

# User Registration and Authentication

Users are provided with the ability to register and log in to the Greecebnb platform, facilitating personalized interactions and access to exclusive features. Leveraging 
authentication APIs from Google and GitHub, the registration process is simplified, enabling users to seamlessly connect their existing accounts with Greecebnb.

# House Listing
The basis of Greecebnb is its wide variety of house listings and categories, which are carefully managed to fit the different interests and needs of its customers. When users join in, they are presented with a full database of available rental properties, including detailed descriptions, multimedia content, and filtering options to narrow their search.

# Booking 
Greecebnb enables users to easily book their selected accommodations. Users may easily select their chosen rental properties and complete the reservation procedure 
thanks to the straightforward booking functionality. 

# Favorites 
Understanding the importance of user preferences and convenience, Greecebnb has included a favorites management tool. Users can bookmark their preferred rental 
properties for future reference and to speed up the booking process.

# Advertise your Properties
In addition to exploring existing rental listings, Greecebnb allows users to become hosts by creating their own listings, allowing users to rent out their properties inside the 
Greecebnb platform.

# Trip Cancelation and House Deletion

Greecebnb ensures flexibility by providing trip cancellation alternatives and allowing hosts to properly manage their listings. Users can cancel their listings as needed. Hosts, 
on the other hand, have the ability to delete their rental listings, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date property availability information.
